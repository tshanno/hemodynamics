<p>Thus, in going from recumbent to erect there is 
an increase in absolute pressure below the heart (e.g., 
in most of the body), although there is no change in 
the pressure gradient producing flow.  However, the increase in 
absolute pressure means that the pressure in the capillaries will 
be greater, favoring filtration of fluid OUT of the capillaries and 
hence favoring edema formation.</p>
<p>NOTE: How to think about vertical columns above and below the heart.  
The model system we are considering has a heart and circulation that function together to produce a pressure at 
the aorta (MAP) equal to 100 mm Hg.  While the model is recumbent, the pressure at the arterial end of each organ 
is 100 mm Hg (remember, the pressure drop along the arteries is quite small).</p>
<p>When the model is erect there is 
clearly a vertical column of blood in both the arterial compartment and the venous compartment; the column above 
the heart is at most 40 cm high and the column below the heart is at most 60 cm high.  However, with the model 
vertical, the pressure at the aorta is still 100 mm Hg.  That pressure is regulated by your reflexes.</p>
<p>As we proceed down from the aorta to point 
\"a\" the pressure increases because there is an additional vertical column of fluid of increasing height above 
each point we consider.   At point \"a\" the hydrostatic pressure from this vertical column is 45 mm Hg 
(corresponding to the pressure created by the 60 cm column of blood from the aorta to that point).  The 40 cm 
column that is present above the heart does not add to this because the 100 mm Hg pressure at the aorta includes 
the effect of that column (and the pressure generated by the heart).</p>
<p>If we look above the heart, the pressure there declines by 0.75 mmHg for each cm of height.  
Hence the arterial pressure above the heart is less than 100 mmHg.</p>
<p>Note also that though the pressures change when a person goes from lying down to erect 
that ΔP does <b>not</b> change and that there is, therefore, <i>no change in blood flow</i>.</p>";

$Explanation = "<p>The urine is less concentrated in the sickle cell patient.  That means that there is more fluid and less solute - i.e. that the osmolarity of the urine in the nephron is lower.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the sickle cell patient can’t concentrate his/her urine because they cannot maintain a high enough osmolarity in the renal medulla.  This limits the movement of water out of the nephron because the water concentration is too high in the medulla.  The reasons for this inability to generate an osmotic gradient are not well understood.  I will be glad to discuss it with you but the explanation will likely be more meaningful after you have had cardiovascular and renal physiology.</p>
<p>Please note that as far as the physiology is concerned I do <b><i>not</b></i> expect you to know about sickle cell anemia for this class.  I <b><i>do</i></b> expect you to be able to predict the consequences of an increased or decreased osmolarity in terms of water movement in a system.</p>";

Opposing the process of filtration in a capillary is the process of reabsorption. Water is reabsorbed when it moves from the tissues back into the capillary lumen (purple arrows).  The process is driven by a difference in the osmolarity between the tissues (i.e. the interstitial space) and the capillary lumen.

$Explanation = "<p>The osmolarity must be higher in the capillary lumen in order for water to move down its concentration gradient.  The difference in osmolarity across the capillary wall is, in fact, very small (only about 0.5%).  It is due to the presence of proteins such as albumin in the blood which cannot cross the capillary wall.  This difference is small but extremely important in capillary fluid dynamics.  The osmotic pressure contributed by non-diffusable protein molecules is known as the oncotic pressure.  That is, the oncotic pressure is higher in the capillary lumen.  We will learn more about this in the cardiovascular section.</p>";

Given the above, you have a patient who is malnourished and is therefore not producing proteins such as albumin at a rate necessary to maintain its normal concentration in the blood.  You would expect:

B.  No change in the amount of fluid in the tissues</br>

$Explanation = "<p>You would expect tissue swelling.  Decreased albumin in the capillary lumen leads to decreased osmolarity.  That means increased water concentration.  Since in the process of reabsorption the water flows from the interstitium to the capillary down its concentration gradient, increasing water concentration in the capillary lumen will impede this process.  Less reabsorption means that fluid accumulates in the tissues.  This is known as edema.  It is an extremely common symptom of a variety of diseases.  It appears when the fluid balance across the capillary wall which is illustrated below is disrupted in some way.  You will learn much more about edema in the cardiovascular lectures.</p>";
